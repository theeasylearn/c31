what is structure?
---------------------------------
structure is one type of special variable in which we can store different types of related values.
for example we can store name, surname, age, gender and weight of student into one variable. 
first we have to define structure, then we can create one or more structure type of variable.
each structure has member variable which can be of any type. structure can have integer, float, double string or even array or structure type variable. 

how to create structure
syntax
struct structurename 
{
    type variablename;
    type variablename;
    type variablename;
};

how to create structure type variable 
struct structurename variablename; 

union
---------------------------------------
union is also one type of structure but in union only one variable has value. for example we have union called player which has 2 variables one is run and other is wicket. now we store value in run, wicket will not store value. vice versa.
syntax
union union-name 
{
    type variablename;
    type variablename;
    type variablename; 
}

example
union player 
{
    int run;
    int wicket;
} //2
